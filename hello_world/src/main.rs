// This code has been created using "cargo new hello-world"

// Functions are introduced with fn.
// Blocks are delimited by curly braces like in C and C++.
// The main function is the entry point of the program.
// Rust has hygienic macros, println! is an example of this.
// Rust strings are UTF-8 encoded and can contain any Unicode character.
